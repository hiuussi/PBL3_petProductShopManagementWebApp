# petProductShopManagementWebsite
This is a project that I worked on with two of my friends, Chau Hoang Phi and Pham Phu Phuoc, during the second semester of our second year to complete the report for the Project Based Learning 3 course at Danang University of Science and Technology.

The task requires building a website application based on the MVC model, with a user interface. For this project, I have chosen the topic of managing a pet product store and utilized a database built on mySQL database. Additionally, I used the Java as the main programming language, along with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, etc. for this web application.

The program has the functionality of role-based login, distinguishing between the store staffs and store customers, along with CRUD operations, functions include viewing the list of products, placing orders, managing personal information for customers, and managing data and revenue for store employees.

Before running this application, you have to use the .sql file in the MySQLdatabase folder to create a database for managing the pet product store on your own server.
